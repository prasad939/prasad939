"Because even sensors have bad days" 📡

What I Built:

🏗️ End-to-end ML pipeline that's smoother than my morning coffee

🎯 XGBoost with optimized imputation - achieving 99.6% accuracy (almost as accurate as my mom's cooking timing)

☁️ AWS deployment - because the cloud is today's magic

⚖️ SMOTE & TOMEK links - making data imbalance cry uncle

🔍 Actionable insights - telling sensors "I see you" 👀

🧪 Research & Academic Adventures
🎓 My Academic Journey
Data-driven biodiesel research - making cars green and mathematicians jealous 🌱

ML meets spectroscopy - because XRD, XPS, and NMR needed some AI friends

Response Surface Methodology + ML - the ultimate optimization power couple

Quantum Machine Learning research - where I break reality with Functional Analysis ⚛️

"I speak fluent Mathematics, Python, and occasionally Human" 👨💻
